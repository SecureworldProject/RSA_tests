# RSA_tests
Libraries for RSA cipher/decipher in C and Python.

## Chosen libraries
- C: `openssl`
- Python: `criptography`


## All tested libraries

### C
- `openssl` - The OpenSSL Project develops and maintains the OpenSSL software - a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication. The projectâ€™s technical decision making is managed by the OpenSSL Technical Committee (OTC) and the project governance is managed by the OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC). The project operates under formal Bylaws.

  For more information, refer to the file `Instrucciones OpenSSL.txt`.


- `RSA-Library` from andrewkiluk - A custom C library for RSA encryption made by andrewkiluk that provides three functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption. Detailed descriptions of these functions are provided in the header file rsa.h. No good encyrption practices are ensured so it is not recommended for any production purposes.

### Python
- `criptography` - It is a pip-installable package (`pip install cryptography`) which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives with the goal to be the cryptographic standard Python library. It includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions. It supports Python 3.7+ and PyPy3 7.3.10+.
